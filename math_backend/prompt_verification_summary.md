# Prompt Configuration Verification Summary

## Current Status
- ✅ The BEIJING_BILINGUAL_PROMPT template is correctly configured in `app/config/prompt_templates.py`
- ✅ The template includes all required elements:
  - Character names (黄小星, 李小毛)
  - Character interests (玩车, 看动画片, 画画, 运动)
  - Character locations (北京, 歌德堡)
  - Character genders (男生, 女生)
  - Bilingual requirements (瑞典语, 中文)
- ✅ The template is correctly imported and used in `app/problems.py`
- ✅ The template is correctly imported and used in `app/providers/replicate_provider.py`
- ❌ Replicate API authentication is failing with a 401 error

## Issues Identified
1. **Replicate API Authentication Failure**:
   - The Replicate API token is not being accepted by the API
   - Multiple tokens have been tried without success
   - This prevents the character-based problem generation from working correctly

2. **Fallback Problem Generation**:
   - The system is currently generating basic math problems without character information
   - The problems are bilingual (Chinese and Swedish) but lack the character-specific content

## Recommendations
1. **Verify Replicate API Token**:
   - Check if the Replicate API token has expired
   - Verify the token has the correct permissions
   - Generate a new token if necessary

2. **Alternative Provider Implementation**:
   - Consider implementing an OpenAI provider as a fallback
   - Update the provider factory to use available providers

3. **Local Testing Strategy**:
   - Continue testing with the current basic problem generation
   - Focus on ensuring the frontend correctly displays bilingual problems
   - Implement character selection in the UI independent of problem generation

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the current implementation to Fly.io
2. Test the deployed application with basic bilingual problems
3. Work with the user to resolve the Replicate API authentication issue
