# Math Learning App Deployment Verification Report

## Testing Results

### Backend API

✅ **Backend API is functioning correctly**:
- Root endpoint returns proper status and AI service configuration
- Problems/next endpoint successfully returns bilingual questions with character integration
- Character-based problem generation is working correctly

### Frontend Application

✅ **Frontend is accessible at**: https://math-learning-app-frontend-new.fly.dev/

✅ **Login functionality works** and creates/retrieves user accounts

✅ **Bilingual questions display correctly** in both Chinese and Swedish

⚠️ **Mixed Content Warnings** still appear in the console:
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://math-learning-app-frontend-new.fly.dev/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://math-learning-app-backend.fly.dev/users/'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

⚠️ **405 Method Not Allowed Error** when accessing generator endpoint:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405 ()
```

### Character Integration

✅ **Character integration in problems** is working correctly:
- Problems include both 黄小星 and 李小毛 characters
- Questions are properly formatted with character interests (cars, drawing)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Mixed Content Issues**:
   - Update all API endpoint URLs in the deployed frontend build to use HTTPS
   - Ensure the backend is configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS

2. **Fix 405 Method Not Allowed Error**:
   - Update the frontend to use the correct endpoint (/problems/next) instead of /generator/generate
   - Ensure all API calls use the correct HTTP methods

3. **Complete Deployment**:
   - Manually deploy the frontend and backend using the Fly.io web interface
   - Verify all endpoints are accessible over HTTPS

## Conclusion

The application is partially functional with the core features working correctly. The remaining issues are related to HTTPS configuration and endpoint usage, which can be resolved with the recommended fixes.
