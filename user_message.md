# Math Learning App Deployment Status

I've verified the Math Learning App functionality and identified the following:

## What's Working ✅

1. **Backend API** is functioning correctly:
   - Successfully returns bilingual questions with character integration
   - Character-based problem generation works properly

2. **Frontend Application** is accessible at: https://math-learning-app-frontend-new.fly.dev/
   - Login functionality works
   - Bilingual questions display correctly in both Chinese and Swedish
   - Character integration in problems works correctly

## Remaining Issues ⚠️

1. **Mixed Content Warnings** in the console:
   - The frontend is making HTTP requests to the backend while being served over HTTPS
   - This is causing some API calls to be blocked by the browser

2. **405 Method Not Allowed Error** when accessing generator endpoint:
   - The frontend is using an incorrect endpoint or HTTP method

## Code Changes Made

1. **Fixed API Implementation**:
   - Updated all API endpoints to use HTTPS consistently
   - Added protocol enforcement with `.replace('http://', 'https://')`
   - Implemented multi-endpoint fallback strategy for API calls

2. **Enhanced Character Selection**:
   - Added support for both 黄小星 and 李小毛 characters
   - Implemented dynamic character switching in TutorChat component
   - Ensured character preferences are saved in localStorage

3. **Updated Backend CORS Configuration**:
   - Added support for all frontend domains
   - Configured proper HTTPS handling

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. The code changes have been committed to the repository, but deployment to Fly.io encountered authentication issues.

2. You can manually deploy the updated code using:
   ```
   export FLYCTL_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   flyctl deploy
   ```

3. Alternatively, use the Fly.io web interface to deploy the latest code.

Would you like me to provide more detailed instructions for manual deployment?
