# Math Learning App Deployment and Fixes Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the changes made to fix the Math Learning App for Kids, focusing on resolving mixed content errors, 405 Method Not Allowed errors, and restoring character selection functionality.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Mixed Content Errors**
   - Problem: The frontend was making HTTP requests to the backend while being served over HTTPS
   - Solution: Updated all API endpoints to use HTTPS consistently with `.replace('http://', 'https://')`

2. **405 Method Not Allowed Errors**
   - Problem: The frontend was using GET for `/generator/generate` which only accepts POST
   - Solution: Updated API implementation to use `/problems/next` endpoint instead

3. **Character Selection Functionality**
   - Problem: Character selection was limited to only 黄小星
   - Solution: Implemented full character selection with both 黄小星 and 李小毛

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint Security

All API endpoints now enforce HTTPS with a fallback mechanism:

```typescript
// Secure API base URL enforcement
const secureEndpoint = endpoint.replace('http://', 'https://')
```

### Multi-Endpoint Fallback Strategy

Added a robust fallback mechanism to handle API failures:

```typescript
// Try each endpoint in sequence
for (let i = 0; i < API_ENDPOINTS.length; i++) {
  const endpoint = API_ENDPOINTS[i]
  try {
    // API call logic
  } catch (error) {
    // Switch to next endpoint if available
  }
}
```

### Character Selection Implementation

Enhanced TutorChat component to support dynamic character selection:

```typescript
// Get preferred character from localStorage or use default
const preferredCharacterId = localStorage.getItem("preferred_character") || "huang-xiaoxing";
const { currentCharacter, CharacterSelector } = useCharacter(preferredCharacterId);
```

### Backend CORS Configuration

Updated CORS configuration to support all frontend domains:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://math-learning-app-qt3bvm4s.devinapps.com",
        "https://math-learning-app-frontend.fly.dev",
        "https://math-learning-app-frontend-new.fly.dev",
        # Other origins...
    ],
    # Other CORS settings...
)
```

## Testing Results

The backend API is functioning correctly:

1. **Root Endpoint**:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "ai_services": {
       "replicate": true,
       "deepseek": false
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Problems/Next Endpoint**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "880a500c-51ba-4ca2-ba01-02696541fb7b",
     "question": {
       "zh": "黄小星有5个苹果，李小毛给了他3个苹果。黄小星现在有多少个苹果？",
       "sv": "Huang Xiaoxing har 5 äpplen. Li Xiaomao ger honom 3 äpplen till. Hur många äpplen har Huang Xiaoxing nu?"
     },
     "answer": 8,
     "difficulty": 1,
     "hints": "[\"\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u7528\\u52a0\\u6cd5\\u6765\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\"]",
     "knowledge_point": "加法",
     "type": "word_problem"
   }
   ```

## Deployment Status

The code changes have been successfully committed to the repository. However, deployment to Fly.io encountered authentication issues that will need to be resolved manually.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the deployment to Fly.io using the web interface or with proper authentication
2. Verify the deployed application works correctly with all the implemented fixes
3. Consider implementing additional error handling and logging for better debugging
