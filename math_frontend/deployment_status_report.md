## Deployment Status

The frontend has been built successfully and the code changes have been committed to the repository. However, deployment to Fly.io encountered authentication issues.

### Next Steps

1. Manual deployment can be performed using:
   ```
   export FLYCTL_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   flyctl deploy
   ```

2. Alternatively, the frontend can be deployed using the Fly.io web interface.

## Testing

The updated code has been tested locally and works correctly with the following improvements:
- Character selection works properly
- API calls use HTTPS consistently
- Bilingual questions display correctly
- Error handling provides graceful degradation
