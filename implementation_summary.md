# Bilingual Problem Generation with Character-Based Content

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Prompt Configuration**:
  - Configured BEIJING_BILINGUAL_PROMPT template with all required elements
  - Template includes character names, interests, locations, and genders
  - Template supports bilingual problem generation (Chinese and Swedish)

- **Provider Integration**:
  - Updated Replicate provider to use the BEIJING_BILINGUAL_PROMPT template
  - Implemented proper error handling for API authentication issues
  - Added fallback problem generation for when API authentication fails

- **Frontend Implementation**:
  - Added character selection UI with both 黄小星 and 李小毛 characters
  - Implemented character-specific greetings and messages
  - Enhanced TutorChat component to support multiple characters
  - Deployed frontend to https://math-learning-app-qt3bvm4s.devinapps.com

### ❌ Issues
- Replicate API authentication is failing with a 401 error
- This prevents the character-based problem generation from working correctly
- The system is currently generating basic math problems without character information

## Technical Details

### Character Implementation
Both characters are implemented in the frontend with their specific traits:
- **黄小星 (Huang Xiaoxing)**:
  - Beijing boy who likes cars and watching animations
  - Character avatar: 🐱
  - Greeting: "你好！我是黄小星，来自北京。让我们一起来解决这道数学的题目吧！我最喜欢玩车和看动画片了！"

- **李小毛 (Li Xiaomao)**:
  - Gothenburg girl who likes drawing and sports
  - Character avatar: 🎨
  - Greeting: "Hej！我是李小毛，来自瑞典歌德堡。让我们一起来解决这道数学的题目吧！我最喜欢画画和运动了！"

### API Authentication Issue
The Replicate API authentication is failing with a 401 error:
```
API call failed: ReplicateError Details:
title: Unauthenticated
status: 401
detail: You did not pass a valid authentication token
```

## Next Steps
1. Obtain a valid Replicate API token
2. Update the token configuration in the deployed application
3. Test the character-based problem generation with the new token
